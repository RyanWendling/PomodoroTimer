# pomodoroTimer
Create a Pomodoro timer that will follow the classic pattern of 4 rounds of 25 minutes with a 3-5 minute break and then after 4 rounds a break of 15-30 minutes. Uses HTML, CSS, JQuery, and Bootstrap. Hosted on Heroku.


To use the timer, press the "start/stop" button to begin the countdown. Press the button again at any time to pause the timer. You can reset the timer to the beginning of the Pomordo chain with the "Reset" button.
